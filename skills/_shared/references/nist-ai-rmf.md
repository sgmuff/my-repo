## 1. Status

AI RMF 1.0 is the current version. NIST calls it a living document. Its versioning changes the first number only for a major revision. Secondary sources report that a revision has been under way since the July 2025 White House AI Action Plan, but no successor had been published as of October 16, 2026. *Volatile:* check nist.gov before citing 1.0 as current in an external document.

The AI RMF is voluntary. It matters here as the organizing framework for AI risk work, as a mapping target for AIUC-1, and as evidence of reasonable care.

## 2. Structure and trustworthy characteristics

**Four functions.** GOVERN is cross-cutting and applies throughout. MAP establishes context and identifies risks. MEASURE analyzes, assesses, and tracks them. MANAGE prioritizes and acts on them. There are 19 categories and 72 subcategories in total.

**Seven characteristics of trustworthy AI** (AI 100-1, §3):

1. Valid and reliable
2. Safe
3. Secure and resilient
4. Accountable and transparent
5. Explainable and interpretable
6. Privacy-enhanced
7. Fair, with harmful bias managed

AI impact assessments use these as the headings for their trustworthiness analysis, alongside AIUC-1's domains.

**Profiles.** As in the Privacy Framework, an organization can build Current and Target Profiles, and NIST publishes use-case profiles such as the Generative AI Profile.

## 3. Generative AI Profile risks

NIST AI 600-1 names twelve risks that are unique to generative AI or made worse by it. Use them as a checklist when screening a generative AI system or vendor:

1. CBRN information or capabilities
2. Confabulation (confidently stated false content)
3. Dangerous, violent, or hateful content
4. Data privacy (leakage, unauthorized use, inference of sensitive information)
5. Environmental impacts
6. Harmful bias and homogenization
7. Human-AI configuration (over-reliance, automation bias, anthropomorphizing)
8. Information integrity (misinformation and disinformation at scale)
9. Information security (lowered barriers to attacks; prompt injection; data poisoning)
10. Intellectual property
11. Obscene, degrading, or abusive content, including CSAM and non-consensual intimate imagery
12. Value chain and component integration (third-party components, data, and models)

The profile also maps suggested actions to AI RMF subcategories. Read it when building an AI impact assessment for a generative system.

## 4. The Core

The short titles are AIUC's labels, not NIST's. The outcome text is NIST's. The AIUC-1 column inverts AIUC's crosswalk, with retired requirements reassigned to their successors (`aiuc-1.md`, §6). A dash means AIUC maps no requirement, so AIUC-1 alone leaves that outcome open.
